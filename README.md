# MERN CRUD

## Testing the waters with the MERN stack

I created a runner registration app with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) using CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). This was a really fun project to build as it was the first time that I created a database. You can add or delete competitors and you can edit the distance of each competitor. I focused on the functionality and added CSS styling only to make the app readable.

### Instructions to run the app on your computer

1. Clone these two repositories:
   <br>
   Client: <code>https://github.com/Attila-101/mern-crud-client</code>
   <br>
   Server: <code>https://github.com/Attila-101/mern-crud-server</code>
2. Run the client files from your terminal using the <code>yarn run start</code> command
3. Run the server files from your terminal using the <code>node server.js</code> command
4. View the app in your browser at <code>http://localhost:3000</code>

Make sure that you have yarn installed and both the client and the server are running at the same time.
